# Hi there, I'm Timon 👋

Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio!
I'm a Full Stack Developer based in Kapfenberg, Austria.

Here are some quick facts about me:
 
- :mortar_board: I'm a graduate of the [UpLeveled](upleveled.io) Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp (soon).
- :computer: Always trying to learn new things, currently learning more about **Python/Data Science**.
- :hospital: In my former job I was an anesthesiologist
- :camera: My biggest passion outside programming is photography (gear acquisition syndrom is real, y'all!)
- 💬 Ask me about astrophysics. I know way too much about it for someone who didn't study it.
- 🌄 Hiking is pretty awesome!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can point with the second toe of my right foot. Still have to figure out a use case though.
