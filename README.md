# Hi there 👋

I'm Timon, a Full Stack Developer based in Kapfenberg, Austria.

### Quick facts
 
- :mortar_board: I'm a graduate of the [UpLeveled](https://upleveled.io) Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
- :computer: Always trying to learn new things, currently learning **Rust**. Follow my journey on [my learning blog](https://dertimonius.dev) 🙌
- 📋 Contributed to Open Source!
- :camera: My biggest passion outside programming is photography (gear acquisition syndrom is real, y'all!)
- 💬 Ask me about astrophysics. I know way too much about it for someone who didn't study it.
- 🌄 Hiking is pretty awesome!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can point with the second toe of my right foot. Still have to figure out a use case though.
